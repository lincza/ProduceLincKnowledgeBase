## Overview

ProduceLinc offers powerful pallet file processing and pallet tracking from packhouse to receiver, with complete revenue and cost tracking throughout the supply chain.

### Highlights

- Fully automated import and processing of pallet files for pallet stock creation (intakes), loadouts, pallet updates, pallet verification (stock recon)


- For client’s who prefer a more hands-on approach for pallet files, some or all of the automated pallet file processing functions can be switched off.


- Easy visibility of pallet stock available for loading by means of refreshable Excel files.


- Process pre-departure quality documents for pallets in stock to provide information of quality grades and remarks to the commercial team.


- Produce Price functionality that allows you to update and maintain intended sales and purchase prices based on criteria that you define.


- Create produce orders for transfer and outbound (sales) even before pallet stock is available. This provides visibility to the appropriate teams (commercial, logistics and finance) of supply and demand.


- Allocate pallets from available stock to produce orders using Excel allocation, auto-allocation and manual allocation.


- Manage credit limits with your choice of formal credit limit checking when produce orders are released, or review available credit limits in a refreshable report.


- Link produce orders to freight (vessel-voyage, local trucks, air freight, etc.).


- Collaborate with team members on bookings.


- Generate loading instructions for packhouses / cold stores and other 3rd party members such a freight forwarders and transporters.


- Process pallet files for the loadouts (PO, MT, RL) and update the produce order allocation and related freight container with the necessary information.


- Generate export documentation and local freight documentation.


- Confirm freight containers and hand over to the debtors team by generating produce trades.


- Process debtors invoices from produce trades. This includes the ability to process advance invoices and final account sales, or fixed price invoices.


- Process account sales costs on debtors invoices.


- Process arrival QC documents for traded pallets and update customer quality information on the related pallets.


- Create claims for produce trades and link them to arrival QC documents. Choose between using formal approval workflows or a more hands-on approach to update pallets with intended credit prices and prepare the produce trade for the credit posting.


- Assign service provider costs to freighter trip legs, freight containers, produce trades, pallets or pallet lots.


- Define your own cost items (pallet charges) for your business’ cost chain and set up standard rates using rich filter criteria for your pallet charges.


- Generate, calculate and post advances for your producers


- Process producer invoices for fixed-price (purchase deals)


- Generate and calculate final account sales / income and cost for pallets using Produce Bills. Choose from a number of options for the effective exchange rate to be used. 


- Review final income and costs in a dynamic Excel file that allows you to import price adjustments for producers back into the system.


- Provide producers with summarised and detailed payment advices for payments.


- Provide various teams in the business with detailed reporting – from stock and logistics through to finance, income and costs per pallet.
