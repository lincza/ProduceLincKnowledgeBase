# Overview: Freight Containers

The **Freight Container** page can be accessed by selecting the associated **Freighter Trip Leg** and choosing **Freight Containers** under the *Process* menu or by searching for **Freight Containers**.

New freight container codes can be created directly from this page, or at the time allocating pallets for freight (see **Freight Allocations**).

In this page each line represents a freight container, identified by its unique **Freight Container Code**with visibility of the associated **Freighter Trip Leg Code**.

Additional fields on the Freight Container allows for storing of information such as:  
- Booking Reference  
- Temptale Type Code  
- Shipping Temperature  
- information about the Freight Agent and Freight Forwarder
- Load date (stuff date)  
- indicators for Steri containers and containers that loaded at Multiple Freight Points  
- Haulier, Shipper and Exporter Codes  
- Consignee and Notify Party  
- specified Regime Code and Solas Method

Information of the pallets for a selected container is shown with the use of the **Show Contents** and **Show Pallet IDs** function in the *Actions* menu. **Show Contents** displays the detail pallet lines in a subform and includes information about the produce specification, allocated transfer/delivery points and intended prices. **Show Pallet IDs** opens a subpage with a list of Unique **Pallet IDs** in the container. Here the **Temptale ID** can be manually updated against the relevant Pallet ID, or will show the value as updated from the container confirmation pallet file entry.

The Freight Container page includes a function in the *Actions* menu to **Create/Update Produce Trades**. This function can be performed once the logistical information of the trip leg and freight container has been reviewed and se as **Confirmed** on the Freight Container. The **Produce Trades**field will indicate if produce trade exist, or not.

To allocate pallets to Freighter Trip Legs and Freight Containers, see **Freight Allocations**.
