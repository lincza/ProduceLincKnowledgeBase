Freight and Logistics Management

ProduceLinc's freight management functionality allows for easy allocation of pallets to **Freighter Trip Legs** and **Freight Containers** to track the movement of pallets.

Pallets are allocated to freight containers and freighter trip legs with ProduceLinc's **Freight Allocation** feature.

The functionality includes the generation of Load Instructions, Loading Notifications (packing lists) and PPECB addendum reports directly from the system.
