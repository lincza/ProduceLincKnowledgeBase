# How to set up Pallet File Translations
---

- Search for **Pallet File Translations**.

- Choose **New** to create a blank new line for a new translation rule

- Choose the **Pallet File Definition** for which the translation rule should apply in **File Definition**. This field may not be left empty.

- The next fields are optional filter fields that allow for the setup of a more specific translation rule. These fields may be left empty.

- Choose the field for which a value must be translated in **Field ID** (use the assist-edit button in the field to go to a lookup page with a list of available Field IDs). The **Field Name** will populate when the **Field ID** is selected.

- Type the value from the pallet file (the value that has to be translated) in **Pallet File Code**. To translate an empty value from the pallet file to a default value, leave this field empty.

- Type the value to which the Pallet File Code must be translated in **Translated Code**. Ensure that this value corresponds with your master data.

An unlimited number of translation rules can be set up. Simply repeat the steps above to set up more rules.
