How to resolve "File could not be mapped"

That error refers to the Pallet file purpose mapping not set up.

Navigate to the Pallet File Purpose Mapping Page and create a new code with the first 5 characters of the file name followed by a full stop. In this case it will be POC22. . After that choose the file purpose from the drop down and select if it should be automatically confirmed.
